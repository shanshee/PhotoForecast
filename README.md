# PhotoForecast

PhotoForecast is a specialized web application designed for real estate photographers. It allows users to search for the location of a photoshoot and provides a detailed weather forecast for the week, including optimal times for photography based on weather conditions and light levels. The app also displays sunrise and sunset times to assist photographers in planning twilight photos.

PhotoForecast serves as a valuable tool for real estate photographers who need to schedule shoots based on specific lighting and weather conditions. The idea for this project stemmed from a personal need, as I often found myself needing to plan photography sessions around the weather. The application integrates Google Maps for location searching and uses the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data. This project highlights my abilities to integrate various technologies and APIs to create a functional and user-friendly application.
